# Challenge Title

Create linked-list that has the following methods:

- `insert(value)` which adds a new node with the given value to the beginning of the list
- `includes(value)` which returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list
- `toString()` which returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:

`"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"`

## Approach & Efficiency

| Method | Time | Space |
|--------|------|-------|
| insert | O(1) | O(1) |
| includes | O(n) | O(1) |
| toString | O(n) | O(1) |
